# Gang of Four - Design Patterns

Gang of Four Design Patterns in C++11.

## Usage

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./Gang_of_Four_Design_Patterns <Design Pattern>
```
`<Design Pattern>` argument is any one of the patterns located in `src/` (without spaces). For example, for Abstract Factory replace `<Design Pattern>` with `AbstractFactory`.

## TODO

* Improve user experience by making it more intuitive
* Add design patterns illustrations and explanations.
